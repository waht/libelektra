/**
 * @defgroup kdbnotification Notification
 *
 * @brief Notification feature
 *
 * For an introduction to notifications please see the
 * <a href="doc_tutorials_notifications_md.html">Notification Tutorial</a>.
 *
 * @par Global Mounting
 *
 * elektraNotificationOpen() loads and mounts the
 * <a href="https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/internalnotification">internalnotification plugin</a>
 * globally at run-time.
 * The key database is not altered permanently.
 * elektraNotificationClose() reverts the mounting.
 *
 * The internalnotification plugin is mounted at its defined positions
 * (see
 * <a href="https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/internalnotification">its plugin docs</a>).
 *
 * - If no plugin is mounted at a desired position the internalnotification
 *   plugin is simply mounted.
 * - In the default configuration or when mounting a plugin globally using
 *   `kdb global-mount` the
 *   <a href="https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/list">list plugin</a> is
 *   mounted at all positions.
 *   This plugin allows to mount multiple plugins at a position.
 *   If this plugin is present at a position the internalnotification plugin is
 *   added to the list plugin's configuration at run-time.
 * - If another plugin is mounted at a desired position the configuration is
 *   considered broken and mounting is aborted.
 *   The list plugin requires to be mounted at all positions in order to keep
 *   track of the current position and call plugins accordingly.
 *
 * @par Transport Plugins
 *
 * Notification transport plugins (or simply transport plugins) export
 * "openNotification" (ElektraNotificationOpenNotification()) and
 * optionally "closeNotification" (ElektraNotificationCloseNotification())
 * functions as part of their contract.
 *
 * The function "openNotification" is called during elektraNotificationOpen().
 * At this point an I/O binding is set and it is save to use it.
 * If no binding is set despite the plugin requires it, it should log a message
 * and perform no additional operations.
 * This ensures that the plugin can be used in applications that do not use I/O
 * bindings or notification features.
 *
 * ElektraNotificationOpenNotification() receives a callback and additional data.
 * When a key change notification is received (or a change is detected by other
 * means) this callback shall be called with the changed Key and the additional
 * data.
 *
